# pocket-gg-library-images
Sega Game Gear & Sega Master System library images for the Analogue Pocket. Based off of the images from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/).

Check the [releases link](https://github.com/g026r/pocket-pce-library-images/releases) for the latest zips.

## Important Note

I don't know when I'll actually get around to fixing this. For now it mostly exists to host a collection of SMS images with no guarantee of accuracy as I haven't had a chance to see how well the no-intro datomatic matches with the Pocket library.

## Installation Notes

To install, unzip the archive of your choice & put the resulting `gg` folder in the `/System/Library/Images` directory on your sdcard.
